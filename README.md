## Description
This project is the website of Delani Studio, a software development company. The website advertises their services, displays contact information, and it also showcases their past projects. Near the bottom of the page, the user can enter their name and email, and leave a message. After entering this info, the webpage raises an alert thanking the user for getting in touch.
The projects uses jQuery to add some interactivity. Under the "What We Do" section, the user can click on various services and have more info about the services displayed. Also, if the user hovers over items in the portfolio section, a semi-transparent box appears over the images showing the project name.
